   void SelectCurrentOption();      // Enter submenu or apply setting
   void ApplyThemeSetting(Theme theme);
   void ApplyDefaultPanelSetting(const char* panelName);
   void ExitToOilPanel();
   ```

       std::set<size_t> viewedErrors;
       bool allErrorsViewed = false;
   };
   
   void CycleToNextError();                    // Short press behavior
   void ClearAllAcknowledgedErrors();          // Long press behavior

## Conclusion

The Clarity project is in an excellent state with all major architectural components successfully implemented. The remaining work represents polish, completion of specific features, and thorough testing rather than fundamental changes. 

This 3-week plan will bring the project to 100% completion of the documented requirements while maintaining the high quality and ESP32-optimized design that has been established. The focus is on:

1. **Completing panel behaviors** to match documented specifications
2. **Verifying integration** through comprehensive testing
3. **Finalizing the system** with cleanup and performance validation

Upon completion, the Clarity system will fully implement the sophisticated coordinated interrupt architecture with centralized restoration, providing a robust and memory-efficient automotive gauge platform for the ESP32.
