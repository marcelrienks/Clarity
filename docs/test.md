# Clarity Unit Test Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, multi-phase approach to implementing unit tests for the Clarity ESP32 digital gauge system using PlatformIO and Unity framework. The implementation follows industry best practices for embedded systems testing, emphasizing dependency injection, mocking, and hybrid native/embedded testing strategies.

## Success Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

### Completion Requirements
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All tests must run successfully with zero failures
- **No Commented Tests**: All test code must be active and functional
- **Single Command Execution**: `pio test` runs complete test suite
- **Code Coverage Priority**: Focus on critical business logic over test quantity
- **Build Integration**: Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Documentation**: All test cases documented with clear purpose

### Quality Gates
- **Phase Gate**: Each phase must achieve 100% pass rate before proceeding
- **Regression Gate**: Existing functionality cannot be broken by test implementation
- **Performance Gate**: Test execution time under 30 seconds for native tests
- **Maintainability Gate**: Test code follows same quality standards as production code

## Architecture Overview

### Test Strategy: Hybrid Native/Embedded Approach
- **Native Testing**: Fast iteration on host machine for business logic
- **Embedded Testing**: Hardware validation on target ESP32 device
- **Mock Strategy**: Interface-based mocking for hardware dependencies
- **Dependency Injection**: All testable code uses injectable interfaces

### Test Categories by Priority
1. **Sensors** (Phase 1): Core data acquisition and processing
2. **Managers** (Phase 2): Business logic and state management  
3. **Components** (Phase 3): UI logic without rendering
4. **Integration** (Phase 4): End-to-end behavior validation

## Phase 1: Foundation & Sensor Tests (Critical Priority)
