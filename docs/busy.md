### 🔧 Key Technical Fixes Implemented

**Root Cause Resolution - Type Mismatches**:
```cpp
// Light Sensor (Digital - returns bool)
Reading lightReading = lightSensor->getReading();
bool lightsOn = std::get<bool>(lightReading);  // ✅ Correct

// Oil Pressure/Temperature Sensors (Analog - return int32_t)
Reading pressureReading = oilPressureSensor->getReading();
int32_t pressure = std::get<int32_t>(pressureReading);  // ✅ Correct
```

**Variable Name Conflict Resolution**:
```cpp
// Before (conflicting):
MockGpioProvider* mockGpio;        // Used in multiple files ❌
OilPressureSensor* sensor;         // Generic name ❌

// After (resolved):
MockGpioProvider* lightMockGpio;   // ✅ Unique per test file
MockGpioProvider* oilPressureMockGpio;
OilPressureSensor* oilPressureSensor;
OilTemperatureSensor* oilTempSensor;
```

**Timing Logic for Time-Based Sensors**:
```cpp
// Oil sensors have 1000ms update intervals - need mock time advancement
set_mock_millis(0);
Reading reading1 = sensor->getReading();

set_mock_millis(1500);  // Advance past 1000ms interval
Reading reading2 = sensor->getReading();  // ✅ Triggers actual update
```
