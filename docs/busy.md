### ✅ PRIMARY SUCCESS: Complete Sensor Integration

**Problem RESOLVED**: Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of crash issue (error code 3221226505) - type mismatches and interface compatibility issues between sensor test files.

**Current Achievement**: 
```bash
================= 50 test cases: 50 succeeded (100% success rate) =================
```

## Current Achievement Status: 🎯 **50 Tests Running Successfully**

**Test Results**: ✅ **50 test cases: 50 succeeded (100% success rate)**

### ✅ Completed Implementation Tasks
1. **✅ Fixed ArduinoJson compatibility** - DeserializationError handling for production vs test builds
2. **✅ Resolved variable name conflicts** - Global variable collisions between sensor test files completely resolved
3. **✅ Fixed method interface issues** - Removed nonexistent `hasValueChanged()` calls from all sensors
4. **✅ Complete sensor integration** - All 5 major sensors working with proper type handling
5. **✅ Type compatibility fixes** - bool/int32_t/double handling properly implemented across all tests
6. **✅ Test pattern standardization** - Consistent approach for sensor value change detection
7. **✅ Build configuration stability** - PlatformIO test command working correctly with expanded test suite

### 🔧 Key Technical Fixes Implemented

**Root Cause Resolution - Type Mismatches**:
```cpp
// Light Sensor (Digital - returns bool)
Reading lightReading = lightSensor->getReading();
bool lightsOn = std::get<bool>(lightReading);  // ✅ Correct

// Oil Pressure/Temperature Sensors (Analog - return int32_t)
Reading pressureReading = oilPressureSensor->getReading();
int32_t pressure = std::get<int32_t>(pressureReading);  // ✅ Correct
```

**Variable Name Conflict Resolution**:
```cpp
// Before (conflicting):
MockGpioProvider* mockGpio;        // Used in multiple files ❌
OilPressureSensor* sensor;         // Generic name ❌

// After (resolved):
MockGpioProvider* lightMockGpio;   // ✅ Unique per test file
MockGpioProvider* oilPressureMockGpio;
OilPressureSensor* oilPressureSensor;
OilTemperatureSensor* oilTempSensor;
```

**Timing Logic for Time-Based Sensors**:
```cpp
// Oil sensors have 1000ms update intervals - need mock time advancement
set_mock_millis(0);
Reading reading1 = sensor->getReading();

set_mock_millis(1500);  // Advance past 1000ms interval
Reading reading2 = sensor->getReading();  // ✅ Triggers actual update
```
