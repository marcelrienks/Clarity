## Overview
Clarity is an ESP32-based automotive digital gauge system featuring a 1.28" round LCD display (240x240 GC9A01 driver). The system provides real-time engine monitoring, security status display, and system configuration through an advanced interrupt-driven architecture optimized for automotive environments.

## Core Architecture

### MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Pattern
- **Models (Sensors)**: Hardware abstraction with change detection for GPIO/ADC inputs
- **Views (Components)**: LVGL-based UI elements with no business logic
- **Presenters (Panels)**: Orchestrate components and handle lifecycle management

### Key Design Principles
- **Single Ownership**: Each GPIO has exactly one dedicated sensor instance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for ESP32's 250KB available RAM constraint
- **Interrupt Safety**: LVGL-compatible processing during UI idle states only
- **Priority-Based Execution**: CRITICAL > IMPORTANT > NORMAL panel switching

## System Components

### Panel System (6 Main Panels)
- **Splash Panel**: Startup animation with configurable duration
- **Oil Panel**: Primary monitoring with dual gauges (pressure/temperature)
- **Key Panel**: Security key status indicator (display-only)
- **Lock Panel**: Vehicle security status (display-only) 
- **Error Panel**: System error management with navigation
- **Config Panel**: Dynamic configuration system with menu generation

### Interrupt Architecture (Advanced Trigger/Action Separation)
- **TriggerHandler**: GPIO state monitoring (Key, Lock, Lights sensors) - processes during UI IDLE only
- **ActionHandler**: Button event processing (short 50ms-2000ms, long 2000ms-5000ms) - evaluates every loop
- **Priority Override**: Sophisticated blocking logic prevents unnecessary panel switches
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatic return to last user-driven panel when triggers deactivate

### Sensor Architecture
- **BaseSensor Pattern**: Templated change detection across all sensor types
- **Handler Ownership**: TriggerHandler owns GPIO sensors, ActionHandler owns button sensor
- **Panel Ownership**: Data panels create their own ADC sensors for continuous monitoring
- **Change Detection**: First-read initialization with atomic state updates

## Hardware Configuration

### Target Hardware
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-WROOM-32 (NodeMCU-32S)
- **Display**: 1.28" round LCD (240x240 GC9A01 driver) via SPI2_HOST
- **Input**: Single button GPIO 32 with INPUT_PULLDOWN
- **Memory**: 4MB flash with custom OTA partitioning

### GPIO Mapping
- **GPIO 32**: Main action button (universal short/long press)
- **GPIO 25**: Key Present trigger (CRITICAL priority)
- **GPIO 26**: Key Not Present trigger (CRITICAL priority)
- **GPIO 27**: Lock Engaged trigger (IMPORTANT priority)
- **GPIO 33**: Lights On trigger (NORMAL priority - theme switching)
- **GPIO 34**: Debug error trigger (development builds only)
- **GPIO 36/39**: ADC sensors (oil pressure/temperature)

## Configuration System

### Dynamic Configuration Architecture
- **Self-Registering Components**: Any component can register configuration requirements
- **Automatic UI Generation**: ConfigPanel dynamically generates menus
- **Type-Safe Access**: Compile-time checking with runtime flexibility
- **Persistent Storage**: NVS-based configuration persistence across reboots

### Configuration Categories
- **Oil Sensors**: Units (C/F, PSI/Bar), update rates, calibration offsets/scales
- **Theme Settings**: Day/Night mode selection and styling
- **Splash Screen**: Duration configuration (1500ms-2500ms)
- **System Settings**: Default panel selection, update rates

## Error Handling System

### Error Architecture
- **Global ErrorManager**: Singleton service for centralized error collection
- **Bounded Queue**: Maximum 10 errors with FIFO replacement
- **Priority Integration**: Error trigger with CRITICAL priority overrides all panels
- **Error Levels**: WARNING (auto-dismiss 10s), ERROR (user action), CRITICAL (immediate attention)

### Error Flow
1. Component reports error to ErrorManager
2. Error trigger evaluates true when errors pending
3. ErrorPanel loads with CRITICAL priority
4. User navigates/acknowledges errors
5. System restores to previous panel when errors cleared

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management (30.7KB Flash Savings Achieved)
- **Error Handling Optimization**: 15KB saved (fixed-size buffers vs dynamic strings)
- **GPIO Hot Path**: 3KB saved (eliminated allocations in critical paths)
- **Component System**: 2.5KB saved (removed hot path logging)
- **Sensor Architecture**: 2.1KB saved (eliminated double reads)
- **Panel System**: 1.8KB saved (animation state optimization)

### Processing Efficiency
- **Static Arrays**: Prevent heap fragmentation on ESP32
- **Template-Based Change Detection**: Minimal overhead with type safety
- **Idle-Only Execution**: Triggers process only during UI idle for LVGL compatibility
- **Direct Singleton Calls**: Eliminate context pointers for memory efficiency

## Testing & Quality Assurance
