# Architecture Review

## 1. Entry Point & Bootstrap Separation
**Issue**: Excessive layering without clear value in separating `main.cpp`, `clarity_bootstrap.cpp`, and `clarity_application.cpp`.

**Analysis**: ✅ The separation adds complexity without providing significant benefits. `main.cpp` just delegates to bootstrap, which sets up dependency injection and creates the application.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Consolidated all three files into `main.cpp` for simplicity and removed unnecessary layering.

## 2. GPIO Provider Usage & Naming  
**Issue**: Are all functions in `esp32_gpio_provider` actually used? Where is digitalWrite used? Should be renamed to `gpio_provider`.

**Analysis**: ✅ The `digitalWrite` function is implemented but never used in the codebase - only `digitalRead`, `analogRead`, and `pinMode` are used.

**Recommendation**: Remove unused `digitalWrite` function and rename to `gpio_provider.cpp/.h` for simplicity.

## 3. Provider Purpose
**Issue**: Confirm the purpose of providers - is it simply to allow for unit/integration testing?

**Analysis**: ✅ With testing infrastructure removed, providers now serve hardware abstraction, allowing different hardware implementations without changing business logic.

**Recommendation**: Providers are appropriately used for hardware abstraction.

## 4. IServices vs IManagers Naming
**Issue**: Managers implement services - should IServices be renamed to IManagers, or should managers be renamed to services?

**Analysis**: ✅ There's naming inconsistency - managers implement I*Service interfaces (e.g., PanelManager implements IPanelService).

**Recommendation**: Align naming for consistency - either rename interfaces to IManager* or rename implementations to *Service.

## 5. ServiceContainer vs ComponentRegistry Consistency
**Issue**: ServiceContainer and ComponentRegistry seem to serve similar functions - should they have more consistent naming? What's the difference between a container and a registry?

**Analysis**: ✅ Different purposes: ServiceContainer is a general dependency injection container managing service lifetimes and resolution. ComponentRegistry is a specific factory that uses the ServiceContainer to create components, panels, and sensors.

**Recommendation**: Names are appropriately distinct - container manages dependencies, registry creates specific types. No change needed.
