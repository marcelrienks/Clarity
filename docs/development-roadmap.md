   - **Mitigation**: Parallel implementation and comprehensive testing
   
2. **Performance Risk**: v4.0 may not provide expected benefits
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough prototyping and benchmarking in Phase 3
   
3. **Complexity Risk**: More complex architecture may be harder to maintain
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and developer training

## Success Metrics

### Phase Success Indicators
1. **Phase 1**: Memory usage validated, tests passing, error system complete
2. **Phase 2**: Real hardware validation, performance targets met
3. **Phase 3**: Clear v4.0 decision with supporting data

2. **Performance**: System meets all documented performance targets
3. **Quality**: Stable operation in automotive environment
4. **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented, testable codebase

## Decision Framework

### When to Proceed to Next Phase
Each phase has clear success criteria that must be met before proceeding:
- All tasks completed
- Success criteria achieved  
- No blocking issues identified
- Resource availability for next phase

### When to Stay in Current Phase
- Success criteria not met
- Critical issues discovered
- Resource constraints
- Higher priority needs identified

### When to Rollback
- Unrecoverable issues in new phase
- Performance regression
- Stability problems
- Development cost exceeds benefits

## Summary

The Clarity project has a solid v3.0 foundation that should be stabilized and enhanced before considering architectural changes. The v4.0 migration is optional and should only be pursued if clear benefits are demonstrated through prototyping and analysis.

**Recommended Focus**:
1. **Short-term**: Complete v3.0 stabilization and validation
2. **Medium-term**: Enhance v3.0 with necessary features
3. **Long-term**: Evaluate v4.0 migration only if justified by clear benefits

This approach ensures a stable, functional system while keeping options open for future architectural improvements.
