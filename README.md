[![Test Clarity Gauge System](https://github.com/marcelrienks/Clarity/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcelrienks/Clarity/actions/workflows/test.yml)

# Clarity
An ESP32 project, using platformio, which builds a custom digital gauge for monitoring and displaying your engines key parameters, on various screen configurations and combinations of widgets and sensors.

_**Note:** If all you want is a project for displaying one screen that does one job, this project is sincerely over complicated. This was a test bed for implementing the usual design patterns of OOP, as well as MVP allowing for multiple screens, with multiple widgets, and warning interrupts. That combined with using it to test out AI code assistent Claude means it's far more featured than most would need. But it does work._

## Main Libraries:
* Arduino
* [LVGL](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/)
* [LovyanGFX](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/lovyangfx/)

## Architecture:
Conceptually there is one `device`, with one `display` (this is based on lvgl structure), this can show one of many `panel` configurations, each of which having one or many `widget(s)` shown together. _Note: widgets can be part of many panel configurations (many to many relationship)_
> Device > Display > Panels > Widgets

This is designed around an MVP pattern.  
A sensor will represent the model, and be responsible for handling data reading. A widget will represent the view, and be responsible for building the view for the sensor data. And the panel will represent the presenter, and will be responsible for building and displaying one or more widgets at once.
> Sensor(model) <> Panel(presenter) <> Widget(view)  

Based on an input (either from sensor signal or from a button press) the device/display will load different screens. For example an emergency panel can be shown when a sensor signal moves beyond a threshold, replacing the panel that was configured to display using a button input which normally cycles through multiple screen configurations.

_This would also allow for future extension with more panels configurations and sensors._

## LVGL guidelines
### Screens & Widgets:
Screen Loading is for:
- Panel switching (Oil Panel → Key Panel)
- Major layout changes

Widget Updates are for:
- Data changes within the same panel
- Status updates (key present/absent)

### LVGL Screen Memory Model:
1. Multiple screens can exist in memory simultaneously - Creating screen B doesn't delete screen A
2. Only one screen is active/displayed at a time - When you call lv_screen_load(screen_B), screen A is no longer visible
3. Inactive screens are NOT rendered - LVGL only renders the currently active screen, so screen A stops being drawn/updated
4. Memory remains allocated - Screen A and all its widgets stay in memory until explicitly deleted with lv_obj_del(screen_A)

## Panel-Trigger Architectural Patterns

The system implements several well-established design patterns to coordinate between panels and triggers:

### 🏗️ Core Architectural Patterns

#### **MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Pattern**
- **Model**: Sensors (KeySensor, LockSensor, OilPressureSensor, etc.)
- **View**: Widgets (KeyWidget, LockWidget, OemOilWidget, etc.) 
- **Presenter**: Panels (KeyPanel, LockPanel, OemOilPanel, etc.)

#### **Observer Pattern (Trigger System)**
- **Subject**: InterruptManager continuously evaluates triggers
- **Observers**: Triggers (KeyTrigger, LockTrigger) monitor sensor states
- **Notification**: Panel switches when trigger conditions are met

### 🔄 Panel-Trigger Interaction Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: Direct Panel-to-Sensor Binding**
**Example**: OemOilPanel ↔ Oil Sensors
```
OemOilPanel → directly reads from → OilPressureSensor, OilTemperatureSensor
```
- Panel directly owns and updates from sensors
- No trigger involvement for normal operation
- Used for continuous data display

#### **Pattern 2: Trigger-Driven Panel Switching**
**Example**: KeyTrigger → KeyPanel, LockTrigger → LockPanel
```
Sensor → Trigger → InterruptManager → PanelManager → Panel
```
- Sensors provide data
- Triggers evaluate conditions and decide when to switch
- Triggers specify target panels
- Global interrupt system manages the switching

#### **Pattern 3: Sensor Abstraction Layer**
**Consistent Pattern**:
```
Trigger → Sensor (abstraction) → Hardware (GPIO pins)
```
- **KeyTrigger** uses **KeySensor** 
- **LockTrigger** uses **LockSensor**
- Sensors encapsulate hardware details (GPIO pins, debouncing, etc.)
- Triggers focus on business logic (when to switch panels)

### 🎯 Trigger Management Patterns

#### **Priority-Based Evaluation**
```
InterruptManager evaluates triggers by priority:
0 = KeyTrigger (highest priority)
1 = LockTrigger (lower priority)
```
- Higher priority triggers can override lower priority ones
- Active trigger prevents lower priority triggers from activating

#### **State Machine Pattern**
```
Inactive → Active → Restoration
```
- **Inactive**: No trigger conditions met
- **Active**: Trigger condition met, panel switched
- **Restoration**: Trigger cleared, restore previous panel

#### **Factory Pattern**
```cpp
PanelManager.register_panel<KeyPanel>("KeyPanel");
InterruptManager.register_trigger<KeyTrigger>("key_trigger");
```
- Dynamic registration of panels and triggers
- Template-based type-safe creation

### 📋 Data Flow Patterns

#### **Continuous Monitoring Flow (Oil Panel)**
```
Sensors → continuous readings → Panel → Widgets → UI Update
```

#### **Event-Driven Flow (Key/Lock)**
```
Hardware Event → Sensor → Trigger → InterruptManager → PanelManager → Panel Switch
```

#### **Restoration Flow**
```
Trigger Clears → InterruptManager → PanelManager.get_restoration_panel() → Restore Previous Panel
```

### 🔧 Design Patterns Used

#### **Singleton Pattern**
- `PanelManager::get_instance()`
- `InterruptManager::get_instance()`
- Central coordination points

#### **Strategy Pattern**
- Different triggers implement `ITrigger` interface
- Different panels implement `IPanel` interface
- Pluggable behavior for different hardware states

#### **Template Method Pattern**
- Panel lifecycle: `init() → load() → update() → callbacks`
- Trigger lifecycle: `init() → evaluate() → get_target_panel()`

#### **Dependency Injection**
- Triggers receive sensors in constructor/as members
- Panels receive sensors for data updates
- Loose coupling between components

### 🎭 Specific Panel-Trigger Relationships

#### **KeyPanel ↔ KeyTrigger**
- **Trigger owns**: KeySensor instance
- **Panel owns**: KeyWidget (for display)
- **Data flow**: KeySensor → KeyTrigger (logic) + KeyPanel → KeyWidget (display)
- **Triggering**: Any key state change (Present/NotPresent) → load KeyPanel

#### **LockPanel ↔ LockTrigger**
- **Trigger owns**: LockSensor instance  
- **Panel owns**: LockWidget (for display)
- **Triggering**: Lock engaged (HIGH) → load LockPanel

#### **OemOilPanel (No Direct Trigger)**
- **Panel owns**: Oil sensors directly
- **Role**: Default/restoration panel
- **Triggering**: Restoration target when other triggers clear

### 🔄 Lifecycle Coordination

#### **Startup Flow**
```
1. PanelManager.init()
2. Register all panels with factory
3. Register all triggers with InterruptManager  
4. Load default panel (OemOilPanel)
5. Start continuous trigger evaluation
```

#### **Runtime Flow**
```
1. Continuous sensor monitoring
2. Trigger evaluation every loop
3. Panel switching on trigger activation
4. Panel restoration when triggers clear
5. Continuous UI updates within active panel
```

This architecture provides clean separation of concerns, with sensors handling hardware, triggers handling business logic for panel switching, and panels handling presentation logic.
