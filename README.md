**Embedded display manager**

Embedded display manager currently functioning as a Digital Gauge Cluster for a vehicle. But architecturally generic to be used for managing any type of displays based off of GPIO sensor inputs.
Built for ESP32 system featuring a 1.28" round LCD display (240x240 GC9A01 driver). The application currently provides real-time engine monitoring, security status display, and system configuration through an advanced interrupt-driven architecture for automotive environments.

## üéØ **System Architecture**

### **MVP Pattern Implementation**
- **Models**: Sensors (GPIO/ADC data acquisition with change detection)
- **Views**: Components (LVGL UI rendering - display-only for interrupt-driven panels)
- **Presenters**: Panels (business logic orchestration and lifecycle management)

### **Advanced Interrupt Architecture**
- **TriggerHandler**: GPIO state monitoring (Key, Lock, Lights sensors) - processes during UI IDLE only
- **ActionHandler**: Button event processing (short 50ms-2000ms, long 2000ms-5000ms) - evaluates every loop
- **Priority Override**: Sophisticated blocking logic prevents unnecessary panel switches
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatic return to last user-driven panel when triggers deactivate

### **Key Features**
- **Priority-Based Execution**: CRITICAL > IMPORTANT > NORMAL with blocking logic
- **Type-Based Restoration**: Panel/Style trigger restoration on deactivation
- **LVGL Compatibility**: UI operations only during IDLE state
- **Memory Optimized**: Static arrays, zero hot path allocations

### **Panel System**
- **Oil Panel**: Primary monitoring with dual gauges and continuous sensor readings
- **Key/Lock Panels**: Trigger-driven security status displays
- **Error Panel**: System error management with cycling and clearing
- **Config Panel**: Settings management with persistent storage
- **Splash Panel**: Startup animation with skip functionality
