Your Proposed Architecture

  Core 1 (Producer)

  - Pure pin-change monitoring: Only posts state change messages to queue
  - No logic: Just {triggerId, newPinState, timestamp} messages

  Core 0 (Consumer)

  - FIFO message processing: Process all queued messages to build current state snapshot
  - State consolidation: Multiple messages for same trigger result in final state
  - Priority-ordered execution: Apply all active trigger actions from lowest to highest priority

  Why This Solves All Scenarios

  Scenario 1: Key Present → Active, Key Not Present → Active, Key Present → Inactive

  Queue after processing: [{key_not_present: ACTIVE}]
  Result: Red key panel (only active trigger)

  Scenario 2: Key Present → Active, Key Not Present → Active, Key Not Present → Inactive

  Queue after processing: [{key_present: ACTIVE}]
  Result: Green key panel (only active trigger)

  Scenario 3: Both Key Triggers → Inactive

  Queue after processing: [{lights: ACTIVE}] or []
  Result: Oil panel restored (no blocking triggers active)

  Implementation Benefits

  1. Message Consolidation

  // Multiple messages for same trigger consolidate to final state
  messages: [key_present: HIGH, key_not_present: HIGH, key_present: LOW]
  final_state: [key_not_present: ACTIVE]

  2. Priority-Ordered Execution

  // Apply all active triggers low → high priority
  active_triggers: [lights: ACTIVE, key_present: ACTIVE]
  execution_order:
  1. Apply lights (theme change)
  2. Apply key_present (green key panel overwrites)

  3. Temporal Correctness

  FIFO processing ensures the final state reflects the actual sequence of pin changes, regardless of message processing timing.

  Architecture Advantages

  - Pure separation: Core 1 = hardware only, Core 0 = logic only
  - No race conditions: Single-threaded state consolidation
  - Complete scenario coverage: Handles overlapping activations/deactivations
  - Idempotent: Reapplying same panel is safe
  - Simple debugging: Clear message queue → state → action flow

  This architecture is superior because it builds truth from events rather than trying to maintain concurrent state. The temporal message processing gives you perfect state
  reconstruction at any point in time.
