steps:
  # Wait for simulation start
  - delay: 2000ms
  
  # Initialize with sensor data and day theme
  - set-control:
      part-id: sw1
      control: value
      value: 0  # All DIP switches OFF (day theme)
  - set-control:
      part-id: pot1
      control: value
      value: 300  # Some pressure reading
  - set-control:
      part-id: pot2
      control: value
      value: 400  # Some temperature reading
  - delay: 3000ms
  
  # Verify startup and oil panel load
  - wait-serial: "Loading OEM oil panel with pressure and temperature gauges"
  - delay: 2000ms
  
  # Test sensor data updates instead of theme switching
  # (Theme switching via DIP switches doesn't work in Wokwi simulation)
  - set-control:
      part-id: pot1
      control: value
      value: 800  # Higher pressure reading
