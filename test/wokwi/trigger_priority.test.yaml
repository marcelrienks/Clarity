timeout: 45000ms

steps:
  # Wait for simulation start
  - delay: 2000ms
  
  # Initialize baseline state
  - set-control:
      part-id: sw1
      control: value
      value: 0  # All switches OFF
  - delay: 1000ms
  
  # Verify trigger initialization during startup
  - wait-serial: "Trigger key_present initialized to INACTIVE based on GPIO state"
  - delay: 1000ms
  
  # Wait for splash screen
  - wait-serial: "Loading splash panel with fade-in animation"
  - delay: 5000ms  # Allow time for splash animation
  
  # Verify baseline oil panel
  - wait-serial: "Loading OEM oil panel with pressure and temperature gauges"
  - delay: 2000ms
  
  # Test sensor data updates (DIP switch triggers don't work in Wokwi simulation)
  - set-control:
      part-id: pot1
      control: value
      value: 256  # Quarter pressure
  - delay: 1000ms
  - set-control:
      part-id: pot2
      control: value
      value: 768  # Three quarter temperature
  - delay: 2000ms
