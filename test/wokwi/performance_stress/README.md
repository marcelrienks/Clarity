# Test Suite 7: Performance and Stability Tests

## Test 7.1: Rapid Trigger Switching

### Objective
Test system stability and performance under rapid trigger switching conditions.

## Test Setup
- **Pot1 (Pressure)**: Set to ~600 (higher reading for visibility)
- **Pot2 (Temperature)**: Set to ~700 (higher reading for visibility)  
- **DIP Switches**: All OFF initially (00000000)
- **Test Focus**: Rapid manual trigger switching

## Expected Behavior

### Baseline Performance
- System starts with oil panel showing higher sensor readings (~6 Bar, ~70Â°C)
- All panels should load within 1-2 seconds
- Animations should complete smoothly without stuttering
- No memory leaks or progressive performance degradation

### Rapid Switching Test Sequence

#### Phase 1: Single Trigger Rapid Toggle (30 seconds each)
1. **Key Present Rapid**: DIP #1 ON/OFF rapidly (~2 Hz for 30 seconds)
2. **Key Not Present Rapid**: DIP #2 ON/OFF rapidly (~2 Hz for 30 seconds)  
3. **Lock Rapid**: DIP #3 ON/OFF rapidly (~2 Hz for 30 seconds)
4. **Theme Rapid**: DIP #4 ON/OFF rapidly (~2 Hz for 30 seconds)

#### Phase 2: Multi-Trigger Combinations (2 minutes)
1. **All Panel Triggers**: Rapidly cycle through DIP #1, #2, #3 combinations
2. **Theme + Panel**: Simultaneously toggle theme (DIP #4) while switching panels
3. **Conflict States**: Rapidly activate conflicting triggers (#1 + #2)

#### Phase 3: Stress Pattern (3 minutes)
1. **Random Pattern**: Randomly toggle all 4 DIP switches in unpredictable sequence
2. **Maximum Stress**: All switches ON simultaneously, then rapid individual toggles
3. **Recovery Test**: Return to stable state and verify normal operation

## Test 7.2: Long-Running Stability Test

### Objective
Validate system stability over extended operation periods with periodic trigger changes.

## Test Setup
- **Duration**: 30+ minutes continuous operation
- **Pattern**: Systematic trigger cycling every 2 minutes
- **Monitoring**: Continuous serial output observation

### Long-Running Test Pattern
**Repeat this 2-minute cycle for 30+ minutes:**

1. **Minutes 0-0.5**: Oil panel operation (all triggers OFF)
2. **Minutes 0.5-1**: Key present panel (DIP #1 ON)
3. **Minutes 1-1.5**: Lock panel (DIP #3 ON, #1 OFF)  
4. **Minutes 1.5-2**: Theme switch + oil panel (DIP #3 OFF, #4 ON)

### Extended Test Monitoring

#### Memory Usage Tracking
- Monitor for memory leaks or progressive degradation
- Check for animation buffer overflow issues
- Verify LVGL object cleanup during panel switches

#### Sensor Response Consistency
- Periodically adjust potentiometers during long run
- Verify sensor readings remain accurate over time
- Check for ADC drift or calibration issues

#### Display Stability
- Monitor for pixel burn-in or display artifacts
- Check for color accuracy maintenance
- Verify animation smoothness throughout test

## Pass Criteria

### Stability Metrics
- [ ] **No Crashes**: System runs continuously for full 30+ minutes
- [ ] **Consistent Performance**: Response times remain stable throughout
- [ ] **Memory Stability**: No progressive memory usage increases
- [ ] **Display Quality**: Visual quality maintained throughout test

### Functional Verification
- [ ] **Trigger Accuracy**: All triggers respond correctly after extended operation
- [ ] **Animation Quality**: Needle animations remain smooth after 30+ minutes
- [ ] **Sensor Precision**: Oil sensor readings maintain accuracy
- [ ] **Theme Switching**: Color changes remain accurate and complete

## Expected Serial Output Patterns

### Normal Operation
```
[INFO] Trigger state changes occurring regularly
[DEBUG] Panel transitions completing successfully
[INFO] Sensor readings updating accurately
```

### Warning Signs (Should NOT Appear)
```
[ERROR] Memory allocation failed
[ERROR] Animation timeout or failure  
[ERROR] LVGL buffer overflow
[WARN] Panel transition timeout
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics
- **Panel Switch Time**: < 1 second (95th percentile)
- **Animation Duration**: 2-3 seconds for gauge animations
- **Memory Usage**: Stable (no continuous growth)
- **CPU Usage**: Consistent frame timing

### Stress Test Thresholds
- **Maximum Switch Rate**: 2 Hz (2 switches/second) sustainable
- **Concurrent Triggers**: Handle up to 4 simultaneous trigger changes
- **Recovery Time**: < 5 seconds to normal operation after stress

## Debugging and Analysis

### Performance Issues Investigation
1. **Slow Response**: Check for animation conflicts or LVGL blocking
2. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor panel destruction and object cleanup
3. **Display Artifacts**: Verify buffer management and refresh rates
4. **Stuck States**: Check trigger state machine logic

### Tools and Monitoring
- **Serial Monitor**: Continuous logging throughout tests
- **Visual Inspection**: Regular display quality checks
- **Timing Analysis**: Measure response times during stress
- **Memory Tracking**: Monitor for progressive degradation

## Notes
- These tests validate system robustness under extreme conditions
- Real-world usage unlikely to match this stress level
- Identifies potential race conditions and resource management issues
- Provides confidence in system reliability for production deployment
